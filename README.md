# Advent of Code 2024 in Swift

[![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/language-Swift-red.svg)](https://swift.org)

Daily programming puzzles at [Advent of Code](<https://adventofcode.com/>), by
[Eric Wastl](<http://was.tl/>). This is a small example starter project for
building Advent of Code solutions.

## Template 

Derived from https://github.com/Abizern/swift-aoc-starter-template which itself was
based on the [swift-aoc-starter-example](https://github.com/apple/swift-aoc-starter-example/) provided by Apple

### Changes from the Apple template

- Swift 6 (Have fun with Sendable Types) (by Abizern)  [and I'm still not sure if I'm thanking him for this!]
- Swift Testing instead of XCTest (Abizern) [defintely thanking him for this :) ]
- and various bits of hacking them to my way of working.  Copy the above, not mine, if you are looking for the scaffolding

## Challenges

All code solutions are in the respective day's sources file.

If you want to run, change the `day`  structure in `AdventOfCode.swift` to the appropriate day's.
